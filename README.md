# 2021 Wrapped

Ever since I bought an Apple Watch in 2020, I took data collection to the next level. I've always been a health and fitness enthusiast, but I started tracking every walk, bike ride, gym workout, body measurements, nutrition, and more. Especially being a type-1 diabetic, it's important for me to stay active, eat the right foods, and stay consistent to help manage this disease. 

### Inspiration

After my T1 diabetes diagnosis in May 2021, I realized how my own personal data could impact more than just diabetes management. I began analyzing nutrition data that I had logged in 2020 in MyFitnessPal, blood glucose data from the continous glucose monitor I wear every day, step counts from Apple Health, and body mass from my bluetooth weighing scale. I produced various charts and models but lost motivation in June after realizing the complexity of integrating data from these disjoint sources.

After seeing how "Spotify Wrapped" leverages data science to portray fun, competitive statistics for users to view and share, I was inspried to build my own version, but using health and fitness data instead. Similar to Spotify Wrapped, I was driven to create high-level visuals to share aggregate statistics from my workouts and nutrition through the year.
