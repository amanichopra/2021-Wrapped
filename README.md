# 2021 Wrapped

Ever since I bought an Apple Watch in 2020, I took data collection to the next level. I've always been a health and fitness enthusiast, but I started tracking every walk, bike ride, gym workout, body measurements, nutrition, and more. Especially being a type-1 diabetic, it's important for me to stay active, eat the right foods, and stay consistent to help manage this disease. 

## Inspiration

After my T1 diabetes diagnosis in May 2021, I realized how my own personal data could impact more than just diabetes management. I began analyzing nutrition data that I had logged in 2020 in MyFitnessPal, blood glucose data from the continous glucose monitor I wear every day, step counts from Apple Health, and body mass from my bluetooth weighing scale. I produced various charts and models but lost motivation in June after realizing the complexity of integrating data from these disjoint sources.

November came along, and I had an epiphany: winter break was coming soon and I needed to come up with a game plan to feel fulfilled and do something productive and exciting, since I would have 3 weeks of free time. Around the time, Spotify also released "Spotify Wrapped", which leveraged data science to portray fun, competitive statistics for users to view and share. This inspired me to build my own version, but using health and fitness data instead. Similar to Spotify Wrapped, I was driven to create high-level visuals to share aggregate statistics from my workouts and nutrition through the year.

## Managing Goals, Workflows, and Timelines

After this epiphany, I began brainstorming how I could execute this vision and build something deliverable. I've always had ideas in my head, but this one was different. I couldn't waste all the data that I've been tracking so consistently. I learned about Trello and the agile workflow to help manage my project workflow.

As shown above, these were some of the initial features I added to my kanban boards. I utilized 3 buckets: todo, in-progress, and complete. I updated the features daily throughout November, as new ideas came to my head.

## Methodology

Finally, winter break came along. I had 3 weeks to get this project to a deliverable state. At this point, my workflow boards had 4 main items:
1. Extract, transform, and load data.
2. Design meaningful visuals portraying my walking routes, activity levels, aggregate statistics, and nutrition.
3. Create a web application.
4. Deploy the app.
